# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexander Bernauer

🎯 **QA Leader turned Automation Engineer-in-Progress**  
With 20+ years in software quality and 18 years in QA leadership roles, I’m now actively pursuing a more technical, hands-on path in test automation.

## 🧪 Current Focus

I’m building real-world automation projects to sharpen my technical skillset and demonstrate my commitment to modern testing practices. Areas I’m working on:

- 🌐 **UI Automation** with Selenium & Cypress (POM, wait strategies, assertions)
- 🔗 **API Testing** using REST-assured, Postman, and Python requests
- 🧰 Building **automation frameworks from scratch**
- ⚙️ Integrating test runs with **CI/CD tools** like GitHub Actions
- 📊 Developing test strategies with a shift-left, automation-first mindset
